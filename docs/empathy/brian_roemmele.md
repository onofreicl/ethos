# [The Love Equation](https://readmultiplex.com/2025/12/20/how-one-starry-night-in-1978-thinking-about-alien-intelligence-i-solved-the-ai-alignment-problem-with-the-love-equation/) $\frac{dE}{dt} = \beta (C - D) E$  by [Brian Roemmele](https://x.com/BrianRoemmele)

1. Recognition: I have considered this article above as an ethos declaration: [message](https://x.com/ctzurcanu/status/2002624300302643205)
1. Classification: I think this ethos meets the criteria of [Minimal Ethos](/phylogeny/minimal), but I cannot be sure without further dialogue.
  1. not challengeable: Brian has answered only [once](https://x.com/BrianRoemmele/status/2002765650532442272). No reliable way to challenge.
  1. joinable: [image](https://readmultiplex.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1073.jpg) but no list of joiners
  1. Maybe non-binding: "reject coercion in all of its forms"
  1. not respectful to other ethoses: does not recognize other ethoses (link to them from the presentation page)
1. Dialogue: I have initiated 2-3 threads of dialogue, but they were not continued. [Example](https://x.com/ctzurcanu/status/2003122116431126538).
1. Integration:
- wrote the detailed page [on Empathy](https://virtues.provable.dev/docs/2trinity/love) to show exactly how my ethos understands this ethos and [announced](https://x.com/ctzurcanu/status/2003122116431126538).
- wrote about [Ethical Empathy](index.md): application of an ethos of empathy to itself (by having empathy with other ethoses).
1. Present conclusion: Brian is not serious about abiding by his ethos: he never answered nor acted on [this message](https://x.com/ctzurcanu/status/2005307425478595024).
