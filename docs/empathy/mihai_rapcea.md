# Mihai Rapcea's Ethos

- [video 1](https://youtu.be/Nmv-qWQ6IWA?si=o26tO1hDFAzS3vXZ)
- [video 2](https://youtu.be/Vrz-wt90Sls?si=2jyDMY66RuzGKcVS)

1. Recognition: I have left a commentary on the video and recognized this as being ethos. Commentary was deleted. I have exchanged email messages instead. 
1. Classification: Mihai's ethos meets the criteria of [Minimal Ethos](/phylogeny/minimal), but I cannot be sure without further dialogue.
  1. not upgradeable: Mihai's answers did not clarify this yet
  1. not joinable
  1. not challengeable: this was clarified in video 2
1. Dialogue: I have made several attempts to dialogue with Mr. Rapcea by email. Limited answers by email. Provable upon request. But a clarification by YT video 2 was provided.
1. Present conclusion: Mihai Rapcea has an ethos that is relatively well-established, but not challengeable.
