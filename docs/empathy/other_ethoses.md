# Other Ethoses

Recommended to read [Phylogeny](/phylogeny) first.

## By Class

### Religions

#### Religions that recognise other Ethos

- Buddhism
- Hinduism
- Agnosticism
- Imperial/Syncretic religions:
  - Zoroastrianism
  - Mithraism
  - Statism (recognizing the state as independent from religion)
- Henotheism

These religions meet the criteria of [Minimal Ethos](/phylogeny/minimal)

However: 
  1. None of these ethoses are upgradeable, and they are not challengeable in public
  1. There is no way to have a public dialogue with any

#### Religions that do not recognize other Ethos

- Judaism
- Christianity
- Islam
- Any religion that suppresses public doctrinal debate

These religions do not meet the criteria of [Minimal Ethos](/phylogeny/minimal).

I do not consider these religions worthy of being called religions. They have at least this one cult or sectarian characteristic.

As a self-proclaimed Christian, I have to disent from the way Christianity is understood by the majority, and I declare that [Christianity has to be humble](https://ctzurcanu.github.io/opinion/the_humble.html) itself, as an institution, not only requires humility from the individual. If the majority of Christians refuse to consider me a Christian, I will align myself with their will and give my religion another name.

### Constitutions or documents alike them
