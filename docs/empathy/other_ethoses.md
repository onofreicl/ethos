# Other Ethoses

Recommended to read [Phylogeny](/phylogeny) first.

## By Class

### Religions

#### Religions that recognise other Ethos

- Buddhism
- Hinduism
- Agnosticism
- Imperial/Syncretic religions:
  - Zoroastrianism
  - Mithraism
  - Statism (recognizing the state as independent from religion)
- Henotheism

These religions meet the criteria of [Minimal Ethos](/phylogeny/minimal)

However: 
  1. None of these ethoses are upgradeable, and they are not challengeable in public
  1. There is no way to have a public dialogue with any

#### Religions that do not recognize other Ethos

- Judaism
- Christianity
- Islam
- Any religion that suppresses public doctrinal debate

These religions do not meet the criteria of [Minimal Ethos](/phylogeny/minimal).

I do not consider these religions worthy of being called religions. They have at least this one cult or sectarian characteristic.

As a self-proclaimed Christian, I have to disent from the way Christianity is understood by the majority, and I declare that [Christianity has to be humble](https://ctzurcanu.github.io/opinion/the_humble.html) itself, as an institution, not only requires humility from the individual. If the majority of Christians refuse to consider me a Christian, I will align myself with their will and give my religion another name.

### Constitutions or documents alike them

### United Nations Charter

Signatory [countries](countries.md).

#### Constitutions of Countries

#### Other Constitutions

- Act of Incorporation and Bylaws

## Punctual Ethos

### [The Love Equation](https://readmultiplex.com/2025/12/20/how-one-starry-night-in-1978-thinking-about-alien-intelligence-i-solved-the-ai-alignment-problem-with-the-love-equation/) $\frac{dE}{dt} = \beta (C - D) E$  by [Brian Roemmele](https://x.com/BrianRoemmele)

1. Recognition: I have considered this article above as an ethos declaration: [message](https://x.com/ctzurcanu/status/2002624300302643205)
1. Classification: I think this ethos meets the criteria of [Minimal Ethos](/phylogeny/minimal), but I cannot be sure without further dialogue.
  1. not challengeable: Brian has answered only [once](https://x.com/BrianRoemmele/status/2002765650532442272). No reliable way to challenge.
  1. joinable: [image](https://readmultiplex.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1073.jpg) but no list of joiners
  1. Maybe non-binding: "reject coercion in all of its forms"
  1. not respectful to other ethoses: does not recognize other ethoses (link to them from the presentation page)
1. Dialogue: I have initiated 2-3 threads of dialogue, but they were not continued. [Example](https://x.com/ctzurcanu/status/2003122116431126538).
1. Integration:
- wrote the detailed page [on Empathy](https://virtues.provable.dev/docs/2trinity/love) to show exactly how my ethos understands this ethos and [announced](https://x.com/ctzurcanu/status/2003122116431126538).
- wrote about [Ethical Empathy](index.md): application of an ethos of empathy to itself (by having empathy with other ethoses).
1. Present conclusion: Brian is not serious about abiding by his ethos: he never answered nor acted on [this message](https://x.com/ctzurcanu/status/2005307425478595024).

### [Mihai Rapcea's Ethos](https://youtu.be/Nmv-qWQ6IWA?si=o26tO1hDFAzS3vXZ)

1. Recognition: I have left a commentary on the video and recognized this as being ethos. Commentary was deleted.
1. Classification: I think this ethos meets the criteria of [Minimal Ethos](/phylogeny/minimal), but I cannot be sure without further dialogue.
  1. not upgradeable: Mihai never answered questions about his ethos
  1. not joinable
1. Dialogue: I have made several attempts to dialogue with Mr. Rapcea by email. No answer.
1. Present conclusion: Mihai Rapcea is not performing his duties towards his ethos. It may not even be an ethos.
