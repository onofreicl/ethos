# Other Ethoses

## By Class

### Religions

#### Religions that recognise other Ethos

- Buddhism
- Hinduism
- Agnosticism
- Imperial/Syncretic religions:
  - Zoroastrianism
  - Mithraism
  - Statism (recognizing the state as independent from religion)
- Henotheism

These religions meet the criteria of [Minimal Ethos](/phylogeny/minimal)

#### Religions that do not recognize other Ethos

- Judaism
- Christianity
- Islam
- Any religion that suppresses public doctrinal debate

I do not consider these religions worthy of being called religions. They have at least this one cult or sectarian characteristic.

As a self-proclaimed Christian, I have to disent from the way Christianity is understood by the majority, and I declare that [Christianity has to be humble](https://ctzurcanu.github.io/opinion/the_humble.html) itself, as an institution, not only requires humility from the individual. If the majority of Christians refuse to consider me a Christian, I will align myself with their will and give my religion another name.

### Constitutions or documents alike them

### United Nations Charter

#### Constitutions of Countries

#### Other Constitutions

- act of Incorporation and Bylaws

## Punctual Ethos

1. Classification: I think this ethos meets the criteria of [Minimal Ethos](/phylogeny/minimal), but I cannot be sure without further dialogue.
1. Dialogue: I have initiated 2-3 threads of dialogue, but they were not continued. [Example](https://x.com/ctzurcanu/status/2003122116431126538).
1. Integration:
- wrote the detailed page [on Empathy](https://virtues.provable.dev/docs/2trinity/love) to show exactly how my ethos understands this ethos and [announced](https://x.com/ctzurcanu/status/2003122116431126538).
- wrote about [Ethical Empathy](index.md): application of an ethos of empathy to itself (by having empathy with other ethoses).
