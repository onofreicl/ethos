# Other Ethoses

### [$ \frac{dE}{dt} = \beta (C - D) E $](https://readmultiplex.com/2025/12/20/how-one-starry-night-in-1978-thinking-about-alien-intelligence-i-solved-the-ai-alignment-problem-with-the-love-equation/) by [Brian Roemmele](https://x.com/BrianRoemmele)

1. Recognition: I have considered this article above as an ethos declaration: [message](https://x.com/ctzurcanu/status/2002624300302643205)
1. Classification: I think this ethos meets the criteria of [Minimal Ethos](/phylogeny/minimal), but I cannot be sure without further dialogue.
1. Dialogue: I have initiated 2-3 threads of dialogue, but they were not continued. [Example](https://x.com/ctzurcanu/status/2003122116431126538).
1. Integration:
- wrote the detailed page [on Empathy](https://virtues.provable.dev/docs/2trinity/love) to show exactly how my ethos understands this ethos and [announced](https://x.com/ctzurcanu/status/2003122116431126538).
- wrote about [Ethical Empathy](index.md): application of an ethos of empathy to itself (by having empathy with other ethoses).
