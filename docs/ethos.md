## Hierarchy

Same as in my [Theory of Virtues](https://virtues.provable.dev/docs/hierarchies#virtues-order)


## Evolution

The [commits to this repo](https://github.com/ctzurcanu/ethos/commits/main/) are the evolution path of this ethos.

## No Identity

- whitelist:
  - the fact that I have a guaranteed identity

## Guaranteed Identity

- whitelist:
  - the fact that I have a legal public identity
  - my ethos
  - ethos compatibility interface

## Ethos is not compatible at all

- whitelist:
  - all of the above
  - a message with the compatibility results, the justification for contact, and a proof of effort (MYT spent). The threshold of MYT is now: 1 MYT

## Ethos is (at least) partially compatible

- whitelist:
  - all of the above
  - a contract for starting a chat under the terms of the compatible ethos

## Chat contract is signed by both parties

- whitelist:
  - chat prompt
  - chat menu

## Compatibility

- The top of the hierarchy has to be explicit.
- The ethos has to be updated within a day since a need for change is discovered.
