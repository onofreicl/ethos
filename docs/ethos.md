# My Ethos

  - in [JSON form](/ethos.json)
  - Phylogeny: from [challengeable](/phylogeny/challengeable)

## Declarations

- Ethos is challengeable by this link: [New Challenge](https://github.com/ctzurcanu/ethos/issues/new) A comprehensive history of the challenge types and instances and their ethical conclusions is here: [Issues](https://github.com/ctzurcanu/ethos/issues). I accept new challenges only if they are of a new type or subtype.
I will do my best to answer any challenge within 3 days.

## Definitions

- ethos_ct1 (henceforth: the ethos): The set of beliefs and rational conclusions that I want to motivate my actions. An ethos has to be internally-consistent.
- golden_rule_negative_ct1 (henceforth: the negative golden rule): I do not do to others what I do not wish done to myself.
- golden_rule_positive_ct1 (henceforth: the positive golden rule): What I wish done to myself, I do to others.
- categorical_imperative_ct1 (henceforth: the categorical imperative): I act as if the maxims of my action were to become through my will a universal law of nature.
- other_ethos_ack_ct1 (henceforth: acknowledgement of the existence of another ethos): I acknowledge the existence of other ethos(es) than mine.
- judge_invite_ct1 (henceforth: judgement invitation): I make myself subject of my own declarations and invite others who do the same to judge me by them.

### Virtues

- order_ct1: (henceforth: order): The ordering of virtues that is provable by reason or by consensus. The ordering is a virtue by itself.

## Hierarchy

Same as in my [Theory of Virtues](https://virtues.provable.dev/docs/hierarchies#virtues-order)

## Principles

- I always uphold the negative golden rule.
- With people with known ethos, I sometimes uphold the positive golden rule.
- I uphold the categorical imperative.
- I acknowledge the existence of other ethos(es).
- I invite judgement.


## Evolution

## No Identity

- whitelist:
  - the fact that I have a guaranteed identity

## Guaranteed Identity

- whitelist:
  - the fact that I have a legal public identity
  - my ethos
  - ethos compatibility interface

## Ethos is not compatible at all

- whitelist:
  - all of the above
  - a message with the compatibility results, the justification for contact, and a proof of effort (MYT spent). The threshold of MYT is now: 1 MYT

## Ethos is (at least) partially compatible

- whitelist:
  - all of the above
  - a contract for starting a chat under the terms of the compatible ethos

## Chat contract is signed by both parties

- whitelist:
  - chat prompt
  - chat menu

## Compatibility

- The top of the hierarchy has to be explicit.
- The ethos has to be updated within a day since a need for change is discovered.
