# My Ethos

  - in [JSON form](/ethos.json)
  - Phylogeny: from: 
    - [challengeable](/phylogeny/challengeable)
    - [alignable](/phylogeny/alignable.md)

## Declarations

- minimal
  1. golden_rule_negative: I do not do to others what I do not wish done to myself.
  1. one_ethos: I have only one ethos, made public here.
  1. live_ethos: What I believe, I share in this ethos.
  1. ack_other_ethos: I acknowledge the existence of other ethos(es) than mine.
  1. ack_other_ethos_importance: I acknowledge that unless proven otherwise, other ethos(es) than mine have an equal importance to my ethos.
  1. no_contradiction_claim: I will keep my ethos free of self-contradicting claims.
- challengeable
  1. challengeable: Ethos is challengeable by this link: [New Challenge](https://github.com/ctzurcanu/ethos/issues/new). A comprehensive history of the challenge types and instances and their ethical conclusions is here: [Issues](https://github.com/ctzurcanu/ethos/issues). I accept new challenges only if they are of a new type or subtype.
- upgradeable
  1. upgradeable: I keep my ethos flexible and upgradeable by means of reasonable demonstration or (where lacking) consensus. The upgrade may consist of changing the order of my hierarchy, adding new items, or removing items.
- joinable
  1. joinable: Ethos is joinable by forking this repo and declaring in a public space (such as X.com) that you joined this ethos (with a link to the revision).
- non-binding: Ethos is non-binding: I can leave (un-join) this ethos at any time, for any reason or without a reason. The un-join has to be declared publicly.
- respectuous: I keep my ethos respectuous: my ethos will recognize in public other ethoses. Will abide also by their rules, if not in grave conflict.
- alignable: This ethos is alignable: keeps a list of other ethoses and their classification. Establishes what actions can be executed together and in what ehtical conditions.

- golden_rule_positive_ct1 (henceforth: the positive golden rule): What I wish done to myself, I do to others.

## Hierarchy

Same as in my [Theory of Virtues](https://virtues.provable.dev/docs/hierarchies#virtues-order)


## Evolution

The commits to this repo are the evolution path of this ethos.

## No Identity

- whitelist:
  - the fact that I have a guaranteed identity

## Guaranteed Identity

- whitelist:
  - the fact that I have a legal public identity
  - my ethos
  - ethos compatibility interface

## Ethos is not compatible at all

- whitelist:
  - all of the above
  - a message with the compatibility results, the justification for contact, and a proof of effort (MYT spent). The threshold of MYT is now: 1 MYT

## Ethos is (at least) partially compatible

- whitelist:
  - all of the above
  - a contract for starting a chat under the terms of the compatible ethos

## Chat contract is signed by both parties

- whitelist:
  - chat prompt
  - chat menu

## Compatibility

- The top of the hierarchy has to be explicit.
- The ethos has to be updated within a day since a need for change is discovered.
