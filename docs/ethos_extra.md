# Meta Ethos

## Principles

### The Golden Rule: Positive

- short: `golden_rule_positive`
- long: `What I wish done to myself, I do to others.`

### The Golden Rule: Negative

- short: `golden_rule_negative`
- long: `I do not do to others what I do not wish done to myself.`

## Declarations

### Respect the Categorical Imperative

- short: `categorical_imperative`
- long: `I act as if the maxims of my action were to become through my will a universal law of nature.`
- reference: the [Kantian Categorical Imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative)

### Acknowledge the Existence of Another Ethos

- short: `ack_other_ethos`
- long: `I acknowledge the existence of other ethos(es) than mine.`

### Judgement Invitation

- short: `judge_invite`
- long: `I make myself subject of my own declarations and invite others who do the same to judge me by them.`

### Web Cookies

- short: `web_cookies_level2`
- long: `I accept only cookies that are required for the obvious functionality of the site.`
- basis: Conform to the negative golden rule: I do not use optional (for example tracking and advertising) cookies on the sites that I create. I expect others to do the same unless I opt in.

## Compatibility

### No Contradiction Claim

- short: `no_contradiction_claim`
- long: `I will not transact with persons who have not answered all types of claims that contradict their own ethos. (If I can avoid it.)`

### Have the Top Virtues Explicit

- short: `defined_top`
- long: `I will not transact with persons who have not defined their top values/virtues in their ethos.`

### Known Identity

- short: `known_identity`
- long: `I will not transact with people who do not share their official/legal identity.`

### Reciprocal Declarations

- short: `reciprocal_declarations`
- long: `I confer to other people the level of trust that corresponds to the reciprocal declarations.`

Example: If I `judge_invite` and the other person does the same: we can engage in constructive criticism about our ethos(es) or actions. That means we accept that the other person may make the conversation public in part or in whole.

*Reciprocal_declarations* is a powerful tool of ethos cooperation and it confers access to levels of personal trust that have not been achieved at scale in human history.
