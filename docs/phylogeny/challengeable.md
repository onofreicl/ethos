### Ethos is Challengeable

- short: `challengeable`
- long: `Ethos is challengeable by this link: <link 1> A comprehensive history of the challenge types and instances and their ethical conclusions is here: <link 2>. I accept new challenges only if they are of a new type or subtype.`

The longest period of wait without answer should be 28 days. However: without a good technical explanation for not answering within 3 days: postponing may be considered a lack of Challengeability or a finable offence.

A challenge is of two major types:
- a proof that one has an ethical contradiction:
    - inside one's ethos 2 declarations collide
    - a discrepancy between one's actions (or lack of action) and one's ethos
- a proposal for improving one's ethos by some exact change

A challenge can be performed only by some entity that has challengeable ethos and a conclusion to a challenge is a change in ethos or an ethical fine either to the target entity or to the challenger.
