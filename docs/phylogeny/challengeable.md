## Declarations

### Ethos is Challengeable

- short: `challengeable`
- long: `Ethos is challengeable by this link: <link 1> A comprehensive history of the challenge types and instances and their ethical conclusions is here: <link 2>. I accept new challenges only if they are of a new type or subtype.`

The longest period of wait without answer should be 28 days. However: without a good technical explanation for not answering within 3 days: postponing may be considered a lack of Challengeability.
