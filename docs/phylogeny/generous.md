Matthew 5:

38 “You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ 
39 But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. 
40 And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well."

Luke 6:

27 “But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, 
28 bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. 
29 If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them. 
30 Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. 
31 Do to others as you would have them do to you."
