### Ethos is Respectuous

- short: `respectuous`
- long: `I keep my ethos respectuous: my ethos will recognize in public other ethoses. Will abide also by their rules, if not in grave conflict.`

That also means respecting the law of the land in countries and cities that are visited. Since all countries have their own ethos.
