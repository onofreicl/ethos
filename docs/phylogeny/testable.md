### Ethos Allows for Testability

- short: `testability`
- long: `This ethos uses a meta-ethos that establishes the protocols for testing ethoses in my life.`

Any sovereign public institution should allow for testability. The inability for the institutional constitution to cover all cases diminishes the sovereignty and liberty of the institution. Examples:

- any country constitution should allow the country to become direct democracy, republic, oligarchic, despotic/monarchy/empire for as long as its citizens will it and not a moment longer. (That means: a system of porvable timeless voting as the one implemented by The Laurel Project.)
