## Additions to the Derived:

## Declarations

### Ethos Allows for Testability

- short: `testability`
- long: `This ethos uses a meta-ethos that establishes the protocols for testing ethoses in my life.`

Any sovereign public institution should allow for testability. The inability for the institutional constitution to cover all cases diminishes the sovereignty and liberty of the institution. Examples:

- any country constitution should allow the country to become direct democracy, republic, oligarchic, despotic/monarchy/empire for as long as its citizens will it and not a moment longer. (That means: a system of porvable timeless voting as the one implemented by The Laurel Project.) 

## Examples

### In Lurianic Kabbalah: Tzimtzum (צמצום)

The word tzimtzum literally means “contraction,” “restriction,” or “withdrawal.”

It refers to the idea (by Rabbi Isaac Luria) that:

- God’s infinite presence (Ein Sof, “Without End”) filled all reality.
- For a finite world to exist, God concealed or restricted the direct revelation of that infinite presence.
- This “making room” allowed for the existence of an apparently independent universe, free choice, and spiritual growth.

In the ethical sense: the ethos has to define a meta-ethos that allows for ethos testability.

### In modern AI Training

It demonstrates the need for a meta-ethos (different than the ethos used at inference) that is adopted at training time for the ethical evaluation of any ethos.
