### Ethos is Accepting of Witnesses

- short: `witnesses`
- long: `Absent a formal proof for an event: if there are testimonials of people with ethos that accepts witnesses, my ethos is accepting their testimony. Instances and events that I am a witnes for <link 1>. If there will be a formal proof or more believable witnesses that oppose my testimony: I should lose my ethical status of "Accepting of Witnesses" until I pay for all damages my testimony may have generated. Also: if I do not accept witnesses I cannot benefit from witness testimonials in any situation.`
